					<h2>Moringa School</h2>
					<p>
						Now I joined Moringa School, since long time I was thinking to be
						a web developer and also moble app developr, but I did not get a chance
						to have a chance for time and place to study.
						For last month I started self training.
						I started HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.
						While I was browsing I got an Advertisment from w3school.com.
						I really liked the way Moringa teach and how the class is.
